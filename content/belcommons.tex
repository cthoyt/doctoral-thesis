\chapter{BEL Commons: an environment for exploration and analysis of networks encoded in Biological Expression Language}\label{ch:belcommons}

\section*{Preface}

The following paper describes a BEL Commons: a web application that enables exploration and analysis of networks encoded in \ac{BEL} as well as integration of several disparate features from other prominent web applications for systems and networks biology.
It highlights the way the web application allows for integrative exploration of several publicly available knowledge bases and provide an example of data-driven analysis using publicly available differential gene expression data sets related to \ac{AD}.

\section*{Postface}

One of the issues of the accessibility of \ac{BEL} mentioned in Chapter~\ref{ch:pybel} was the ability for users to use previously published algorithms.
With a front-end web interface that includes detailed instructions, BEL Commons moves the community one step closer to that goal.
More generally, BEL Commmons enables users who are less familiar with programming to access the \ac{BEL} ecosystem.
Finally, the article motivated several improvements, such as the deeper integration of the PyBEL ecosystem with \ac{INDRA}~\cite{Gyori2017} in order to support semi-automated curation and enrichment of knowledge graphs, as well as the importation of other formats like \ac{BioPAX} and \ac{SBML} that are realized in Chapter~\ref{ch:recuration}.
