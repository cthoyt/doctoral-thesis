\chapter{Prologue}
\label{ch:prologue}

The quantity of data, information, and knowledge in the biomedical domain is increasing at an unprecedented rate â€” with no signs of deceleration.
Even with the assistance of information retrieval technologies, it is overwhelming, if not impossible, for individuals or groups of researchers to be knowledgeable of the state of the art in any but an incredibly specific topic.
Besides their obvious increases in volume and velocity, data are also increasing in variety as multi-modal and multi-scale experiments grow more important in the investigation of complex diseases.

As experiments' complexities grow, so does the intellectual and temporal burden of analysis and interpretation.
Developing systematic and reproducible methods to reduce this burden first requires the formalization and assembly of knowledge in a computable form.
The publications in this thesis build towards leveraging and improving previously existing methodologies for extracting, formalizing, and storing biological knowledge to support the development and application of algorithms towards unraveling the complex biology of disease and proposing new therapies.

Before presenting the publications included in this thesis, background is given on several topics present through each including the nomenclature of entities in the biomedical literature, the techniques and formalisms used for biomedical knowledge graphs, algorithms appropriate for analyzing biomedical knowledge graphs, and finally, their applications.
