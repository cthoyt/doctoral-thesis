\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my family, who I've missed very much while I've been so far away.

I would like to thank my advisor, Martin Hofmann-Apitius, for enabling and supporting me throughout this experience.

I would like to thank André Gemünd, Horst Schwichtenberg, and all of SCAI-IT for the help and wisdom that they've shared.

I would like to thank all of my fellow PhDs and my students at Fraunhofer SCAI, who were a joy to work with and mentor.

I would like to thank Scott Colby, who was always there for me even during his own graduate schooling.

Most importantly, I would like to thank Daniel Domingo-Fern\'{a}ndez, who was my partner in all of this and a good friend.
It's been a pleasure working with you.
